This is the main directory for back-end application, which has all the python source code.  
It also has sub directories where log files, and system files are stored
Those directories are : /data-files
                        /system-files
                        /log-files

As the application operates, you will see subdirectories that get created for new matters which 
are named as the matterId, and this is where files are downloaded and processed for each matter
and then subesquently uploaded and put into the SFTP server
